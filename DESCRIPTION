Description: Analysis of dyadic network and relational data using additive
    and multiplicative effects (AME) models. The basic model includes regression
    terms, the covariance structure of the social relations model (Warner, Kenny
    and Stoto (1979), Wong (1982)), and multiplicative factor models (Hoff(2009)).
    Four different link functions accommodate different relational data structures,
    including binary/network data (bin), normal relational data (nrm), ordinal
    relational data (ord) and data from fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn).
    Several of these link functions are discussed in Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and
    Stovel (2013). Development of this software was supported in part by NIH grant
    R01HD067509.
